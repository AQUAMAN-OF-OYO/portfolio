                        Hi! I'm Oluokun Favour, Oluwatobi, I'm passionate about health science and sustainable development.
                I have worked on multiple research projects to develop drug for treating various diseases as well as understanding the
                nature of pathogens. As an advocate for sustainable development, I run a company dedicated to pioneering sustainable access
                to healthy water while reducing plastic wastes, I have trained over 300 youths accross Nigeria on sustainable development, and
                how we can contribute to making our world a better place to live in.

                        This research was carried out using Bioinformatic tools to identify a drug target and a potential drug
                        for treating Trypanosomiasis. At the end of this research, we were able to identify silymarin as a potential drug for treating
                        Trypanosomiasis

                        in various schools accross Lagos and Abuja to eliminate reliance on single-use packaged water and ultimately improve their
                        health and environment.

                        The aim of the the 5 5MILLION-SUPA project is to prevent 5 million single-use plastic wastes used in water packaging from polluting our
                        environment annually by installing TripeF hydration systems accross Nigeria. So far, we have reached about 1 million single-use plastics
                        and still counting.
