# portfolio
This portfolio has a brief description of my interests, and previous enagements. For this project, I used HTML, CSS Tailwind to create the basic structure of the page, as well as some basic css to add some extra styles. There is a contact form at the bottom of the page that allows the user to provide basic information for contact purpose.
